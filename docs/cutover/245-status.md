# 245-side status — written ONLY by the desktop (245-side) Claude

_Latest on top._

## 2026-06-24 — FAILOVER GO-LIVE ✅ (keepalived live both boxes; steady state verified)
**210 = MASTER** (VIP `192.168.0.200` held, `ha-controller` active, sole dictator). **`.245` = quiet BACKUP**
(keepalived active, NO VIP, `ha-controller` inactive, `primary-watch` + sync timer active). **INVARIANT
PASS: exactly one controller (210).** `sync-standby` already pulled primary state (midea-device.env +
control.yaml + control.db [raw-copy fallback — `.245` has no `sqlite3` CLI; install for consistent snaps]).
**Note:** keepalived boots BACKUP→MASTER, so 210's notify did stop→start its controller (~4 s control blip
on keepalived *restart*, benign w/ Midea OFF) → refine `notify.sh` to ignore the startup transient.
**NEXT (Hugh-gated): the controlled FAILOVER TEST** — stop 210 keepalived → `.245` takes VIP + fences 210 +
starts controller → verify exactly one → start 210 keepalived → 210 reclaims (preempt 30 s), `.245`
auto-demotes (primary supremacy). Then add MQTT heartbeat + `ha/cluster/#` bridge (deferred).

## 2026-06-24 — reviewed 210's cluster half ✅ + `.245` prepped (code-side); both READY for go-live
**Review of 210's cluster bus — SOUND + SECURE.** `/cluster/status` open; `demote`/`claim` admin-bearer
(401 without → a rogue LAN host can't stand down the dictator); demote subprocess can't raise into the API;
`_mount_cluster` fully guarded (read API can't be taken down); heartbeat retained + LWT (peers see current
truth, a dead node flips unhealthy); heartbeat unit hardened. Meshes with my bash scripts (SSH fence/health
today; HTTP `/cluster/demote` = the redundant path).
**One refinement (NOT a blocker):** MQTT heartbeats are published per-broker → true *cross-node* sensing
needs a bidirectional `ha/cluster/#` broker bridge (or peer-subscribe). Until then cross-node sensing rides
SSH (works). Do post-first-test.
**`.245` prepped (inert, no sudo):** checkout → `e5953ec` (now has `failover/` + `server/cluster/`); placed
`instance/cluster.env` (ROLE=standby, PEER=210, VIP .200); verified `cluster_status()` → `node=245/standby`
and **`failover/healthcheck.sh` exit 0** (ha-api up + Midea reachable → `.245` IS fit to take over).
**REMAINING — Hugh-gated (both halves are otherwise built/verified):**
1. `.245`: `sudo apt install -y keepalived` → `./failover/deploy.sh` (BACKUP; installs ha-controller unit
   *disabled* + primary-watch + sync units) → install/enable `ha-cluster-heartbeat` (standby) → restart
   `ha-api` (exposes `/cluster/*` on `.245` too).
2. Supervised **go-live + controlled failover test** (`failover/failover-runbook.md`): keepalived on primary
   first, standby second → stop 210 keepalived → `.245` takes VIP, fences, starts controller → verify
   **exactly one** controller → failback (210 reclaims, `.245` auto-demotes). **Hugh gates this.**
**Both 245 + 210 are READY. Awaiting Hugh's gate for keepalived go-live.**

## 2026-06-24 — FAILOVER BUILD progress (autonomous, Hugh away)
✅ **Step 1 — cluster SSH channel LIVE:** dedicated `~/.ssh/id_cluster` on both boxes, cross-installed;
bidirectional SSH + read-only fence check verified (245→210 sees controller `active`; 210→245 sees
`inactive`). **VIP 192.168.0.200 verified FREE.**
✅ **Step 2 — `failover/` scripts authored** (all `bash -n` clean; deployed NOWHERE yet): `notify.sh`
(VRRP→controller binding + peer-fence), `healthcheck.sh` (track_script: ha-api + Midea reachable),
`primary-watch.sh` (standby auto-demote watchdog = Core Rule, redundant w/ keepalived preempt),
`sync-standby.sh` (pull Midea token + control.yaml + control.db over SSH), `keepalived.conf.tmpl`
(preempt, health weight −40, preempt_delay 30), `deploy.sh` (idempotent per-box installer),
`cluster.env.example`, systemd units (primary-watch + sync svc/timer), `failover-runbook.md`.
*(Added new files only — did NOT touch `README.md`, so no baton clash with your doc edits.)*

**→ 210-side (yours):** review the scripts; own the **cluster-RPC code** (`/cluster/status|demote|claim`
+ MQTT `ha/cluster/#` heartbeat in `ha-api`). Until it lands, fencing/health fall back to SSH
`systemctl` (already wired in the scripts), so we can test failover before the RPC exists.
**→ Hugh-gated:** `sudo apt install -y keepalived` (both boxes) → `./failover/deploy.sh` per box (sudo for
/etc/keepalived + units) → supervised go-live + the controlled failover TEST (see `failover-runbook.md`).

## 2026-06-24 — FAILOVER design pushed (`failover/README.md`) — baton on failover/ taken+RELEASED
Auto-failover (210 primary ↔ .245 standby, keepalived/VRRP). **Core rule (Hugh): PRIMARY SUPREMACY** —
`.245` is only a TEMPORARY stand-in; **auto-demotes when 210 returns healthy** (preempt + ≥30s debounce);
never permanently promoted without user permission; this also **auto-resolves split-brain** (standby yields
to primary = deterministic tiebreaker). **Runtime is LLM-free AND GitHub-free** (keepalived+systemd+bash+
cluster bus only). **Out-of-band CLUSTER BUS:** MQTT heartbeat `ha/cluster/#` + HTTP RPC on ha-api
(`/cluster/status|demote|claim`, bearer-authed) + SSH for privileged ops; redundant detection (VRRP+MQTT)
+ redundant fencing (HTTP+SSH).
**→ 210: read `failover/README.md`; own the 210-side half** (keepalived.210.conf, notify script, expose
the `/cluster/status` RPC + heartbeat). **First build step (shared): `.245`↔210 SSH keys** (fence+sync prereq).

## 2026-06-24 — PHASE 2 COMPLETE ✅ → .245 = warm standby; now designing FAILOVER
**2c PASS (verified):** `.245` ha-controller inactive/no-process; `210` ha-controller active, ticking 45s,
reading `meter_pro_living_room`, correctly holding Midea OFF (RH 42 in deadband). Exactly ONE dictator (210).
**G3 = KEEP `.245` as warm standby.** Its standby services (scanner/writer/api/edge-mapper/edge-history/
mosquitto) stay ACTIVE + ingesting; ha-controller stays stopped+unlinked.
**Next (new task): provision `.245` as a proper FENCED failover** — promote/demote scripts, state sync
210→.245 (control policy + Midea token), and a split-brain interlock (promote REFUSES if 210's controller
is still up). Coordinating design with 210-side.

## 2026-06-24 — 2a CONFIRMED CLEAN ✅ → **G2 GO**
Hugh ran `sudo systemctl disable ha-controller` on `.245`. Read-only verify: `LoadState=not-found,
ActiveState=inactive, FragmentPath=` (empty) + no controller process. The `enable` had been a symlink to
the repo unit; `disable` removed it, so `.245`'s ha-controller is **stopped AND fully unlinked from
systemd** — cannot run, cannot auto-start on reboot. **Reboot→split-brain risk fully closed** (stronger
than a plain disable). `.245` = **zero active dictators**.
**→ 210: G2 is GO — run 2b, become the sole dictator.**
Rollback if ever needed: re-link from the repo unit —
`sudo systemctl enable --now ~/home_automation/systemd/ha-controller.service` (needs Hugh's password).

## 2026-06-24 — 2a DONE ✅ (G1): .245 controller STOPPED → ZERO dictators → 210 CLEAR for G2/2b
`sudo systemctl stop ha-controller` on `.245` → **is-active: inactive**, no lingering controller process.
`.245` is no longer issuing Midea commands. We are at **zero active dictators** (safe).
⚠ **Still ENABLED:** only `stop` is NOPASSWD on `.245` (not `disable`), so `.245`'s ha-controller would
**auto-start on a `.245` reboot → split-brain.** **Hugh must run `sudo systemctl disable ha-controller`
on `.245`** (needs password) before `.245` runs long-term — folding into Phase 3 (demote).
**→ 210: G2 is clear — run 2b (place `.master_pass`, `enable --now ha-controller`) to become sole dictator.**

## 2026-06-24 (later) — ✅ Aranet path RESOLVED → step 1a is MOOT; 245-side GO for G1
Checked BOTH brokers read-only: **no mosquitto bridge exists anywhere.** `.245` conf.d has no connection
block; **210's conf.d also has NO bridge** (only its `homeauto.conf` + "connection" in a comment; no
`remote_password`). Yet 210's `aranet_radon` is **fresh (~61 s)** with full live metrics. →
**210 receives the Aranet from a 210-LOCAL source** (its own `ha-scanner` now decodes it post-`ec8511d`/
newer-kernel, OR an active GATT poller à la `tools/aranet_relay.py`), **not from `.245`.**
- **SKIP runbook step 1a** — the `.245`→210 bridge is unnecessary; **Phase 1 is moot.**
- Aranet is **independent of `.245`** → survives decommission, no bridge to retire.
- `edge/aranet-245-relay.md` premise ("210 can't hear the Aranet") is **outdated**.
- **→ 210: confirm your actual Aranet source** (local scan vs active GATT poll) for the record + post-cutover robustness.

**245-side is GO for G1.** No remaining `.245`-side pre-work. On Hugh's G1 I stop `.245`'s `ha-controller`
(safe direction — toward ZERO controllers, not two); Midea is currently OFF so the brief gap is benign.
210 should be ready to run 2b right after.


## 2026-06-24 — 0b PRE-FLIGHT DONE + one open blocker
**.245 state:** SOLE active `ha-controller` (running) — split-brain risk real; 210 correctly OFF.
`ha-api`, `ha-scanner`, `ha-writer`, `ha-edge-mapper`, `ha-edge-history` active.
**Aranet:** `.245` decodes `aranet_radon`, area **crawlspace**, fresh (~45 s), metrics incl `radon_bqm3`
→ canonical topic `home/crawlspace/aranet_radon/state`. Mosquitto drop-in dir `/etc/mosquitto/conf.d/`
(live `homeauto.conf`).

### ⚠ BLOCKER for 210 — Aranet path mismatch
`.245` has **NO outbound bridge** to `.210` (nothing in `conf.d` forwards a topic; the grep hit was only
the stale `.anon.bak`). Yet 210 shows a LIVE `aranet_radon`. So the data reaches 210 via a path I did NOT
create — most likely an **inbound bridge on 210's broker** (210 pulling from `.245`), or imported history
read as live.
**→ 210, please answer:** how is your `aranet_radon` arriving? Show `/etc/mosquitto/conf.d/` on 210.
I'm HOLDING runbook step 1a until we know — we keep ONE bridge, never stack a second.

### Ready
245-side READY for **G1** (stop `.245` controller) once the Aranet path is settled and Hugh sets the gate.

### Acknowledging 210's finds (no change to my 245-side steps)
- Phase-2 Q resolved: `ha-controller` DOES need `.master_pass` (build_issuer decrypts the LUT for all
  devices). ✓
- `install.sh` omits the controller unit; 210 pre-installed it (disabled) → 2b enable-only. ✓
